Here are 10 String exercises in Java to help you practice:

1. Reverse a String: Write a method that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed. For example, "hello" should become "olleh".

2. Check for Palindrome: Write a method to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same backward as forward, e.g., "madam" or "racecar".

3. Count Vowels and Consonants: Write a method that takes a string and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and consonants in the string.

4. Find the First Non-Repeated Character: Write a method that returns the first non-repeated character in a string. For example, in the string "swiss", the first non-repeated character is "w".

5. Remove Duplicate Characters: Write a method to remove duplicate characters from a string. For example, "programming" should become "progamin".

6. Count Words in a String: Write a method that counts the number of words in a string. Assume that words are separated by spaces.

7. Check if Two Strings are Anagrams: Write a method to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other. Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters in different orders, e.g., "listen" and "silent".

8. Replace Spaces with a Given Character: Write a method that replaces all spaces in a string with a given character. For example, replacing spaces with dashes in "hello world" would result in "hello-world".

9. Find the Longest Word in a String: Write a method that finds and returns the longest word in a given string. If there are multiple words of the same length, return the first one.

10.Check if a String Contains Only Digits: Write a method that checks if a string contains only digits. For example, "12345" should return true, while "123a5" should return false.

These exercises will help you build a strong foundation in working with strings in Java.
